# BIKE-SALES-DASHBOARD
Process
The original data was cleaned and manipulated in Microsoft Excel, then I used Tableau Public to create an interactive dashboard.


Microsoft Excel
I used Microsoft Excel to clean and generate my data. I have the following columns (which are typical for student performance data):

Assignment Name

Date - date of the assignment

Type - either assignment, quiz or test

Score - what the student scored on the assignment

Total Points - total possible points

Percentage - percentage the student got

Grade - the grade the student got (out of 100)

Notes - any notes the teacher may have 

There are three types of assignments: assignment (like homework), quiz, or test. Each one has a different set of total points. Assignments have a total of 30 possible points, quizzes have a total of 50 possible points, and tests have a total of 100 possible points. Math teachers typically try to keep the assessment points the same to make it easier to grade. Though this is not always the case but for my fictional dataset it is. 


Tableau
Next I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to show student performance. I included the following metrics:

Final Grade

Average Test Score

Average Quiz Score

Average Assignment Score

Test Performance 

Quiz Performance

Assignment Performance

Type of Assignments 

Records (list of all of the assignments)

I kept the dashboard simple and concise. I wanted the focus to be student performance over the semester. How are they doing in their tests, quizzes, and assignments? Are they improving over time? On average how are they doing? 


At the top is the title along with student information like: name, grade, and class. Useful when creating multiple dashboards for different students. Next, are the top metrics to know like the final grade and average scores. Then there are three charts for student performance in tests, quizzes, and assignments. Along with a breakdown of the type of assignments throughout the semester. At the bottom is the table of records. Essentially the raw data for the families/tutors to look at. While this isn't common or the purpose of a dashboard, people like having the ability to look at each record.
