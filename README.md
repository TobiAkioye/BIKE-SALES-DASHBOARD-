# BIKE-SALES-DASHBOARD
## Introduction

I created my own quick dashboard using Excel. It had graphs on a random individuals in their various region, martial status, income . This helped me analyze how users are affect to puchase a bike.


Goal: Show how users's purchase rate is affect based on different factors


Question:  How is the purchase rate currently ?

##Process

The original data was cleaned and manipulated in Microsoft Excel, then I used Excel also to create an interactive dashboard.


###Microsoft Excel
I used Microsoft Excel to clean and generate my data. I have the following columns (which are typical for bike users an non users data):

###User's Data
Marital Status	,Gender	,Income,	Children, Education,	Occupation,	Home Owner,	Cars,	Commute Distance,	Region,	Age,	Age Bracket,	Purchased Bike

I added a column "Age Bracket" to make it easier to clasify and represent the data. 

Pivot table
I created a pivot table tha helped in creating the dashboard

Excel Dashboard
Next I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to show student performance. I included the following metrics:

I kept the dashboard simple and concise. I wanted the focus to be student performance over the semester. How are they doing in their tests, quizzes, and assignments? Are they improving over time? On average how are they doing? 


At the top is the title along with student information like: name, grade, and class. Useful when creating multiple dashboards for different students. Next, are the top metrics to know like the final grade and average scores. Then there are three charts for student performance in tests, quizzes, and assignments. Along with a breakdown of the type of assignments throughout the semester. At the bottom is the table of records. Essentially the raw data for the families/tutors to look at. While this isn't common or the purpose of a dashboard, people like having the ability to look at each record. 

Insights
While the data is made up and the grade is not weighted (like it usually is for most classes), you can still gather some insights. 

After the student began receiving tutoring on 9/30/2022 their overall performance improved.

There are more assignments than tests and because of the way the grade is calculated, the student should focus their time on assignments to get a better grade. 

The student did the worst in Test 1, and should focus on improving that in order to do their best on their final.
